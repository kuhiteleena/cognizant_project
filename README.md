# 🪄 Cognizant Artificial Intelligence Job – Data Science Simulation

This repository contains my project submission for the **Cognizant Artificial Intelligence Job Simulation**, conducted with the **Data Science team at Cognizant**. The simulation focused on analyzing real-world data from **Gala Groceries**, a Cognizant technology-led client, using Python and Google Colab. I applied concepts of exploratory data analysis (EDA), data modeling, and sensor-based insights to deliver business value.

## 📊 Task Breakdown

### ✅ Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed analysis on `sample_sales_data.csv` using **Python** and **Google Colab**
- Extracted key metrics and visualized data distributions
- Identified:
  - Skewed sales quantity distribution
  - Strong correlation between product price and quantity sold
  - Time-bound trends across the dataset
- 🧠 Recommendations:
  - Segment customers for targeted marketing
  - Enrich product metadata
  - Monitor seasonal performance patterns

---

### ✅ Task 2 – Data Modeling (IoT + Sales)
- Modeled data from three key tables:
  - `sales`: transactional records
  - `sensor_storage_temperature`: IoT temperature logs from storage
  - `sensor_stock_levels`: estimated product stock from sensors
- Mapped table relationships using primary/foreign keys
- Defined how data should be joined for insights into stock, sales, and storage conditions

---

### ✅ Task 3 – Schema Presentation
- Created a **data model diagram** showing:
  - 3 interrelated tables
  - Arrows representing join conditions
  - Key columns for relational integrity
- Explained how temperature and stock-level data can influence sales forecasting

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **Google Colab**
- **SQL / Relational Data Modeling**
- **IoT Data Analysis**
- **Git & GitHub**
